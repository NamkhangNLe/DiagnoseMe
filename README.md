## Built With

DiagnoseMe utilizes a range of modern technologies to provide an interactive and educational experience:

- **Flask:** A lightweight web server used to host the Gemini API. Flask's simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice for serving our AI-generated responses.

- **Electron:** A framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron is used to build the user interface of DiagnoseMe, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Gemini:** An AI model developed by OpenAI. Gemini is used to generate the responses for our simulated patient, providing realistic and varied interactions for users.

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used in DiagnoseMe. JavaScript powers the interactive elements of the application, including the chatbot interface.

- **HTML/CSS:** Used to structure and style the user interface of DiagnoseMe.

- **npm:** A package manager for JavaScript, used to manage the project's dependencies.

These technologies come together to create a powerful tool for medical students to practice their diagnostic skills.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can interact with the chatbot by typing your responses into the chat interface. The chatbot will respond as a simulated patient, allowing you to practice diagnosing and treating a variety of conditions.
